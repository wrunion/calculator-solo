# _JavaScript Calculator_

#### _An Epicodus exercise in JavaScript and jQuery, 1.24.20_

#### By **Winter Runion**

## Description

This is a simple web app  calculator that runs on both vanilla JS and jQuery logic. My next step is to refactor the scripts to be pure vanilla JS.

_Please note: this application currently only works if you chose the "happy path" (ie, enter a number, and then an operator, and then another number, and so on.) If you do that, it will alert the correct caluation of your results!_

## To Use

You can see the calculator in action [on this github page](https://wrunion.github.io/calculator-solo/).

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript, jQuery
* CSS library: [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)


## Known Bugs

_This project is in progress. The calculator currently only supports "happy path" operations. If you press multiple operators in succession, for example, it won't work. My next step is to account for all edge cases._ 

_The app also only "alerts" your answers at the moment. My other next step is to implement DOM manipulation so that the input displays the input and calculations as you go._
