# _JavaScript Calculator_

#### _An Epicodus exercise in JavaScript and jQuery, 1.24.20_

#### By _**Winter Runion**_

## Description

This is a simple web app  calculator that runs on both vanilla JS and jQuery logic. My next step is to refactor the scripts to be pure vanilla JS.

_Please note: this application currently only works if you chose the "happy path" (ie, enter a number, and then an operator, and then another number, and so on.) If you do that, it will alert the correct caluation of your results!_

## To Use

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

This project is in progress. The calculator currently only supports "happy path" operations. If you press multiple operators in succession, for example, it won't work. My next step is to account for all edge cases. 

The app also only "alerts" your answers at the moment. My other next step is to implement DOM manipulation so that the input displays the input and calculations as you go.
